# Meme Magic Maker
This extension adds CORS headers to resources, expanding memesyndicate's functionality while also improving overall website speed by removing the need for Flash Player and other bulky frameworks.

If using with Firefox, `manifest_firefox.json` needs to be used instead of `manifest.json` - Firefox does not support service Manifest V3 service workers by default (yet).

The original version of this extension was largely written by [W Biggs](https://github.com/w-biggs). The Manifest V3 rewrite, as well as icons and some other stuff were created by me.
