# Meme Magic Maker
This extension adds CORS headers to resources, expanding memesyndicate's functionality while also improving overall website speed by removing the need for Flash Player and other bulky frameworks.

If using with Firefox, the `extraHeaders` directives need to be removed - Firefox does not support extraHeaders and it will break the extension.

This extension was largely written by [W Biggs](https://github.com/w-biggs). Icons and some other stuff were created by me.
